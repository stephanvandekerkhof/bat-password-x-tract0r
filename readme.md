Simple yet useful example of how to parse every line of every file in every subdirectory to retrieve data formatted a certain way.

It could be used together with grep to even perform regex.

This requires unxutils, a set of linux command line tools compiled for windows, the requirements are included.

Optionally there's DSpeech, by Dimio, you can download it here: http://dimio.altervista.org/eng/, you only need to extract the file dspeech.exe and put in the p-x-t directory.

Enjoy tweaking this one! I can image dumping the registry and look for... i dunno... cdkeys?
