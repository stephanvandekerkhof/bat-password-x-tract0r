# bat-password-x-tract0r [P-x-T]
Simple yet useful example of how to parse every line of every file in every subdirectory to retrieve data formatted a certain way.

Using linux's UNIQ it de-duplicates data and shows what new entries have been added on each file it processes.

It could be used together with grep to even perform regex.

This requires unxutils (sort.exe and uniq.exe), a set of linux command line tools compiled for windows, the requirements are included.

Optionally there's DSpeech, by Dimio, you can download it here: http://dimio.altervista.org/eng/, you only need to extract the file dspeech.exe and put in the p-x-t directory.

Enjoy tweaking this one! I can image dumping the registry and look for... i dunno... cdkeys?
